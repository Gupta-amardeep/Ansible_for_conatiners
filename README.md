# Ansible_for_conatiners
Control the configuration of containers via Ansible.

Control the configuration of containers via Ansible installed on a master container with key based authentication between slave containers. Adhoc commands and Playbooks are easily executed on container as well and can be used as configuration management tool for containers.

With respect to our previous project Container-SSH we have already setup the SSH between the conatiners that is basic 
building block to execute any adhoc command or plays from master conatiner to slave conatiners passwordless.

Please setup SSH first before setting up ansible as given in this repo.
